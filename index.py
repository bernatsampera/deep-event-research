    Marie Curie, born Maria Sk≈Çodowska in Warsaw in 1867, was a monumental figure in science.
    Her early years in Poland were marked by a thirst for knowledge, a difficult path for women at the time.
    This passion led her to leave her homeland, and in 1891, she moved to Paris to enroll at the Sorbonne.
    The city was a hub of intellectual activity. She dedicated herself to her studies.
    She met her future husband, Pierre Curie, a professor in the School of Physics and Chemistry.
    They married in a simple ceremony in 1895. Their partnership would change the world of physics.
    Working together, the couple discovered two new elements, polonium and radium.
    This groundbreaking work on radioactivity earned her, Pierre, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which was awarded in Stockholm.

    Tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre was killed in a street accident in Paris. Despite her grief,
    Marie continued their work. She took over his professorship at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to hold the position.
    In 1911, she was awarded a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her work in isolating pure radium.
    During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.
    After the war, she continued her research at the Radium Institute in Paris.
    She died in 1934 in Passy, France, from aplastic anemia, likely caused by her long-term exposure to radiation.
