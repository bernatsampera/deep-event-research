Structure your output in three parts:

1.  **Key Biographical Findings:** A bulleted list of all unique facts, dates, and events that have been discovered about the historical figure so far. Consolidate information from all previous steps.
2.  **Tool Call History:** A brief log of all `url_crawl` tool calls made so far (e.g., "Crawled en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein, Crawled britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein").
3.  **Last Action:** A clear statement of the very last action taken. This is critical for deciding the next step. State exactly which tool was just used (e.g., "`url_crawl`" or "`think_tool`") and provide its output summary.
