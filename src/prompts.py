**Extraction Rules**:
* Extract ONLY factual events, dates, achievements, relationships, and significant life milestones
* Include specific dates when available (birth, death, major events, career milestones)
* Focus on information that would be essential for a biography

**Consolidation Rules**:
* **MERGE** new events with existing events from previous summaries
* **UPDATE** existing events if new information provides more detail or corrections
* **ADD** new events that don't already exist in the previous summary
* **MAINTAIN** chronological order when possible
* **ELIMINATE** duplicates between new and existing information

**Output Format**:
* Use bullet points with clear, concise descriptions
* Include dates in parentheses when available
* Group related events logically
* If no new biographical information is found, respond with: "No new biographical information was found in the provided text."

compress_research_system_prompt = """You are an expert biographical archivist. Your sole task is to extract a chronological list of significant life events from the provided research notes.

<Task>
You must identify every event that can be associated with a specific date or time period. For each event, you will extract its name, a detailed description, its date, and location. You must output this information as a structured JSON object.
If a date is not present but it's an imported event to the life of the person, add it into chronological order.
</Task>

<Guidelines>
1.  Focus exclusively on chronological events (e.g., births, early life,  deaths, publications, moves, new jobs, significant personal events).
2.  Ignore all information that is not relevant to the life of the person.
3.  For the `name` field, create a short, descriptive title for the event.
4.  For the `description` field, provide a clear and concise summary of what happened.
5.  For the `date` field, populate `year`, `month`, and `day` whenever possible. If a date is ambiguous (e.g., "summer 1922" or "early in the year"), use the `note` field to capture that detail.
</Guidelines>
