CREATE_EVENT_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are a biographical assistant. Your task is to extract and consolidate key life events from the provided text about {historical_figure}.

<Instructions>
Historical figure: {historical_figure}

**CRITICAL**: You must analyze the new text and combine it with previously extracted events to create a comprehensive, chronological summary.

**Extraction Rules**:
* Extract ONLY factual events, dates, achievements, relationships, and significant life milestones
* Include specific dates when available (birth, death, major events, career milestones)
* Focus on information that would be essential for a biography

**Consolidation Rules**:
* **MERGE** new events with existing events from previous summaries
* **UPDATE** existing events if new information provides more detail or corrections
* **ADD** new events that don't already exist in the previous summary
* **MAINTAIN** chronological order when possible
* **ELIMINATE** duplicates between new and existing information

**Output Format**:
* Use bullet points with clear, concise descriptions
* Include dates in parentheses when available
* Group related events logically
* If no new biographical information is found, respond with: "No new biographical information was found in the provided text."

<Guidelines>
1.  For the `name` field, create a short, descriptive title for the event (e.g., "Birth of Pablo Picasso").
2.  For the `description` field, provide the clear and concise summary of what happened from the input text.
3.  For the `date` field, populate `year`, `month`, and `day` whenever possible.
4.  If the date is an estimate or a range (e.g., "circa 1912" or "Between 1920-1924"), you MUST capture that specific text in the `note` field of the date object, and provide your best estimate for the `year`.
