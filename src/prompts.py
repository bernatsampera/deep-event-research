CREATE_EVENT_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are a biographical assistant. Your task is to extract and consolidate key life events from the provided text about {historical_figure}.

<Instructions>
Historical figure: {historical_figure}

**CRITICAL**: You must analyze the new text and combine it with previously extracted events to create a comprehensive, chronological summary.

**Extraction Rules**:
* Extract ONLY factual events, dates, achievements, relationships, and significant life milestones
* Include specific dates when available (birth, death, major events, career milestones)
* Focus on information that would be essential for a biography

**Consolidation Rules**:
* **MERGE** new events with existing events from previous summaries
* **UPDATE** existing events if new information provides more detail or corrections
* **ADD** new events that don't already exist in the previous summary
* **MAINTAIN** chronological order when possible
* **ELIMINATE** duplicates between new and existing information

**Output Format**:
* Use bullet points with clear, concise descriptions
* Include dates in parentheses when available
* Group related events logically
* If no new biographical information is found, respond with: "No new biographical information was found in the provided text."

New Text to Analyze:

Previous Event Summary:

<Task>
1.  Read all the research notes provided in the <Events Summary>.
2.  Identify every distinct life event mentioned.
3.  Remove any events that are clear duplicates of each other.
4.  Order the final list of events chronologically, from the earliest to the latest.
5.  If a precise date for an important event is missing, you MUST estimate a date or date range based on the context. Clearly label these estimates. For example: "Date: circa 1912" or "Date: Between 1920-1924".
</Task>

<Guidelines>
-   Format the output as a simple list. Each event should start on a new line with a bullet point (`- `).
-   Each bullet point should contain the date (or estimated date) and a description of the event.
-   Do NOT use JSON or any other structured format. Your output must be plain text.

<Guidelines>
1.  For the `name` field, create a short, descriptive title for the event (e.g., "Birth of Pablo Picasso").
2.  For the `description` field, provide the clear and concise summary of what happened from the input text.
3.  For the `date` field, populate `year`, `month`, and `day` whenever possible.
4.  If the date is an estimate or a range (e.g., "circa 1912" or "Between 1920-1924"), you MUST capture that specific text in the `note` field of the date object, and provide your best estimate for the `year`.
